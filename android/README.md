# Library Book Label Detector

This application uses Tensorflow Android Demo (https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/examples/android) as the base, uses custom trained Tiny YOLO as detector model, and integrates with Google ML Kit (https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/) for text recognition.

Currently only "Locate Book" task is implemented.
